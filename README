This is a Work In Progress!  There are no warrantees or Guarantees 
of any type that this code is useable for anything.  But I hope it is.

This is a hacked up version of the USB2AX project that I am trying to add  some
additional functionality.  Also I lot of the testing using a sparkfun atmega32u4
breakout board.  More on how to configure for this soon.

Note: I only have a subset of the files here from the original project.  I don't
have the schematics nor the test programs, nor the LUFA library.  You can grab
all of these files from the original project.

You can find out more information up at the website http://www.xevelabs.com/doku.php?id=product:usb2ax:usb2ax

The original git library is located at: https://paranoidstudio.assembla.com/code/paranoidstudio/git/nodes/master/usb2ax
